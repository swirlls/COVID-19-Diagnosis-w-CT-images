# COVID-19-Diagnosis-w-CT-images

Developed two different CNN models modifying Resnet-50 for binary classification to identify whether a patient has COVID-19 or not. 

## Procedure

1. Create a CNN by modifying Resnet-18 or Resnet-50 for binary classification (Resnet-50 in this case)

2. Train the CNN from scratch with given training, validation, and testing dataset

3. Train the CNN using transfer learning

4. Compare the two models: Test accuracy of both should be at least 90%+

5. Visualize the two models using various CAM methods - GradCAM and EigenCAM was chosen for this project
